 	<H1>ABOUT</H1>
 	<P>The Startup revolves around the idea of creating more number of Electric Vehicle charging Stations in and around Mumbai so as to attract more and more people to switch to a more eco-friendly option.
</P>
<P>At first step we would be opening independent E Power stations at certain locations in Mumbai so as to get maximum visibility.
After which we would collaborate with already existing Petrol Pumps (like HPCL,BPCL,Mahanagar Gas, Indian Oil,ESSAR,Shell,etc) and then placing our power station points alongside their petrol pumps.
This would increase more and more number of accessible charging points for citizens.
Then we would open up a completely solar powered E charging Point, which would be our first step towards generating electricity totally out of renewable sources.
</P>
<DIV>Then we would be adding in portable charging stations (vans), which would reach the customer if there are more than 5 requests in a particular location and would charge the vehicles which will be on standby and the customer must be busy shopping or working.
This would help them save time and fuel.

Then we would also be introducing Subscription Patterns, where we will be charging their vehicle once every day for entire month, so once the customer marks his vehicle as parked on the app, then within 2 hours our vehicles will reach their location and charge their vehicle along with which our technician will also look after its maintenance once a week, and daily car wash services would be complementary. This would help us attract more and more customers.
</DIV>
<DIV>Once we are successful with all the above ideas then we would open up many charging points throughout the city which would be locked with certain password, once the customer completes the payment then he can use that power point to charge their vehicle and this would in all increase more and more users of Electric Vehicles in India.


Our ultimate goal lies to supply power to all our power stations completely through renewable resources , for eg. wind,hydro,solar power,etc.

Our Possible Angel Investor maybe Tata Power,Adani Power,Reliance Power,Shell,Govt Of India
